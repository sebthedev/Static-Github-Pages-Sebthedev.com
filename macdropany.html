          <h2>How MacDropAny Works</h2>
          <p>MacDropAny creates a special connection, called a symbolic link, between folders on your Mac and the cloud. This means that any folder on your Mac can be synchronised online, and accessible from all your devices. Whenever you add, edit, or delete
            a file inside a synced folder, the cloud instantly mirrors these changes.</p>
          <p>Folders synced with the cloud via MacDropAny experience a convenient duality: they are located both in the cloud and locally on your Mac, which means that you benefit from the full power of the cloud, while still being able to view and edit your
            files without an Internet connection.</p>
          <p>MacDropAny isn’t a cloud storage service itself; rather MacDropAny extends the functionality of existing cloud storage services to any folder on your Mac. This means you can use MacDropAny while still continuing to sync your files using the cloud
            storage service you already know and trust.</p>

                  MacDropAny uses some clever technology to sync any folder on your Mac with your favourite cloud storage services. We achieve this goal using different methods depending on which cloud storage service you want to use.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When syncing with Dropbox, Copy, or MediaFire, MacDropAny uses a special type of alias or shortcut called a "symbolic link" or "symlink". MacDropAny creates this alias within the cloud storage folder, and configures it pointing at the external folder
                  that you want to sync with the cloud. This allows your folder to remain in its original location, while still being synced to the cloud.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When syncing with any other cloud storage service, MacDropAny moves the folder you are syncing with the cloud to within the cloud storage folder, and then creates a symlink in the folder's original location pointing at the folder's new location
                  within the cloud storage folder. MacDropAny does this because these cloud storage services do not follow symlinks when they perform their synchronisation with the cloud.

                <p>
                  With MacDropAny it is possible to keep a folder in sync between two computers. For example, this means that you could have your Desktop folder synced between multiple computers. To do this, follow these instructions:
                </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    Stop your sync service (Box.com, Copy, Dropbox, Google Drive, iClouDrive, MediaFire or Microsoft SkyDrive) from syncing. Either use the app’s Pause Syncing feature, quit the app, or disconnect your internet connection.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    On all of the computers with which you’d like to have this folder synced, use MacDropAny to sync the folder with your sync service. You must make sure that, on all of your computers, you give the folder the same name and that you put it in the same
                    location inside your sync service’s folder.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Re-start your sync service. If everything has worked correctly, once your sync service synchronises everything through, you should now have a folder which is mirrored on all of your computers.
                  </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                  Please note that if you have already tried to sync the folder (not following these instructions) and have received an error message saying that MacDropAny can't sync the folder because the folder already exists in the cloud, you will need to follow
                  the instructions below in the "How can I un-sync a folder?" section before following these instructions.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Yes, it is possible to use MacDropAny to sync folders located on external hard drives with the cloud. Just use MacDropAny as normal. When you are asked which folder you'd like to sync with the cloud, navigate to the folder on the external drive, and
                  select it. There are several caveats to bear in mind when syncing folders on external drives with the cloud:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    As explained in the "How does MacDropAny work?" section, when you are syncing folders with any cloud storage service except Dropbox and Copy, the original folder will be moved to the cloud folder, and a symbolic link will be made in the folder's
                    original location to its new location in the cloud folder. If it is important to you that the actual files be located on the external drive, then MacDropAny may not be a good solution for you.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If you are using MacDropAny to sync a folder on an external drive with Dropbox or Copy, and you disconnect the external drive from your Mac (for example, you unplug the external drive), then the cloud storage service will think that you have deleted
                    the files, and consequently the folder contents will be deleted from the cloud and your other devices. When you re-connect the drive to your Mac, syncing should resume, and the files will be undeleted in the cloud.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>

                  There may come the time that you want to stop a folder from syncing. The way that this is done is different for different syncing services.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If you have synced the folder using Dropbox, Copy or MediaFire, then all you have to do is go to the computer from which you originally synced the folder, and delete the instance of the folder inside your Dropbox or Copy folder. The folder will now
                  no longer sync with your other computers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If you have synced the folder using any other service, then then you must go to the computer from which you originally synced the folder, and (in Finder) move the folder from within the sync service’s folder back to its original location. You will
                  most likely be asked whether you want to replace the folder. You must select the “replace” button. The folder will now no longer sync with your other computers.

                <p>
